I am an associate professor at ENSEA graduate school, France. I received my PhD in computer science at Paris 6, France, in 2013. I was a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA Nancy - Grand Est, France and at GREYC, France. I was also a member of the CEA LIST Vision and Learning Lab for Scene Analysis, Paris-Saclay, France.
